# Category Multi-Select UI Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the category selection multi-select mode with improved button design and delete functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved "Single Select" Button
**Before**: Plain text button saying "Single Select"
**After**: Icon button with swap icon and shorter text "Single"

**Visual Changes**:
- Added `Iconsax.arrow_swap_horizontal` icon
- Changed text from "Single Select" to "Single" for better fit
- Uses `OutlinedButton.icon` widget for better visual hierarchy

### 2. Dynamic Cancel/Delete Button
**Behavior**:
- **Normal Mode**: Shows "Cancel" button
- **Multi-Select with Selection**: Shows "Delete (X)" button in red

**Implementation**:
```dart
isMultiSelectMode && hasSelection
  ? OutlinedButton.icon(
      // Delete button (red)
      icon: Icon(Iconsax.trash),
      label: Text('Delete ($selectedCount)'),
    )
  : OutlinedButton(
      // Cancel button (normal)
      child: Text('Cancel'),
    )
```

**Visual Design**:
- Delete button uses error color scheme (red)
- Includes trash icon from Iconsax
- Shows count: "Delete (3)"
- Clear visual differentiation from cancel state

### 3. Delete Confirmation Dialog
**Features**:
- Shows trash icon in error color
- Displays category count to be deleted
- Warning message: "This action cannot be undone"
- Two actions: Cancel and Delete (red button)

**User Flow**:
1. Long-press categories to enter multi-select
2. Select one or more categories
3. Tap "Delete (X)" button
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. Confirm to delete or cancel
6. Categories deleted and UI updates
7. Success message shown

### 4. Database Integration
Added `deleteCategory` method to `DatabaseService`:
```dart
Future<void> deleteCategory(String categoryId) async {
  _ensureInitialized();
  try {
    await _categoriesBox.delete(categoryId);
  } catch (e) {
    throw DatabaseException('Failed to delete category: $e');
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `category_action_buttons.dart`
- Added `onDelete` callback parameter
- Imported Iconsax for icons
- Changed "Single Select" to icon button with "Single" text
- Made Cancel button conditional (Cancel or Delete)
- Added delete button styling with error colors
- Updated both stacked and row button layouts

### 2. `category_selection_screen.dart`
- Added `_showDeleteConfirmation()` method
- Added `_deleteSelectedCategories()` method
- Connected delete callback to CategoryActionButtons
- Implemented dialog with confirmation UI
- Added success/error messaging

### 3. `database_service.dart`
- Added `deleteCategory(String categoryId)` method
- Handles database deletion with error handling

## UI States

### Normal Mode (No Multi-Select)
```
[          Continue          ]
[         Cancel            ]
```

### Multi-Select Mode (No Selection)
```
[     Continue (0)          ]
[  Single  ] [   Cancel    ]
```

### Multi-Select Mode (With Selection)
```
[    Continue (3)           ]
[  Single  ] [  Delete (3) ]
             (Red button)
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
✅ **Clearer Actions**: Icon + text makes buttons more recognizable
✅ **Better Layout**: "Single" text fits better than "Single Select"
✅ **Smart Context**: Delete only shows when categories are selected
✅ **Safety**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Red color clearly indicates destructive action
✅ **Informative**: Shows count of items to be deleted

### Technical
✅ **Conditional Rendering**: Smart button switching based on state
✅ **Error Handling**: Database exceptions caught and displayed
✅ **State Management**: Proper cleanup after deletion
✅ **UI Updates**: Categories list refreshes automatically

## Icon Usage

- **Single Select**: `Iconsax.arrow_swap_horizontal` - Represents switching modes
- **Delete**: `Iconsax.trash` - Universal delete icon
- **Confirmation**: `Iconsax.trash` - Consistent with button icon

## Button Styling

### Single Select Button
- Type: `OutlinedButton.icon`
- Icon: Swap/arrows icon
- Text: "Single"
- Color: Default outline

### Delete Button
- Type: `OutlinedButton.icon`
- Icon: Trash icon (18px)
- Text: "Delete (X)" with count
- Color: Error red
- Border: Error red

### Cancel Button
- Type: `OutlinedButton`
- Text: "Cancel"
- Color: Default outline

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single select button shows with icon
- [ ] "Single" text fits properly on small screens
- [ ] Cancel button shows in normal mode
- [ ] Delete button appears when categories selected
- [ ] Delete button shows correct count
- [ ] Delete button is red/error colored
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears on delete tap
- [ ] Dialog shows correct count
- [ ] Cancel in dialog returns to selection
- [ ] Delete in dialog removes categories
- [ ] Categories refresh after deletion
- [ ] Success message shows
- [ ] Multi-select exits after deletion
- [ ] Works in both portrait and landscape
- [ ] Works in all three themes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Add edit, color change for multiple categories
2. **Undo**: Add undo functionality for deleted categories
3. **Archive**: Option to archive instead of delete
4. **Move**: Bulk move entries to different category
5. **Export**: Export category structure
6. **Animations**: Smooth transitions when deleting
7. **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration on delete confirmation

## Notes

- Preset categories (general, social, etc.) can be deleted
- Deleting a category doesn't delete entries in that category
- No animation for deletion (instant removal)
- Delete is permanent (no undo currently)
- Count updates dynamically as selection changes

## Example Usage

**Scenario**: User wants to delete custom categories
1. Open category selection
2. Long-press a category → Multi-select enabled
3. Tap other categories to select
4. Notice "Delete (3)" button appears in red
5. Tap "Delete (3)"
6. Confirmation dialog: "Delete 3 categories?"
7. Tap "Delete"
8. Categories removed, "Successfully deleted 3 categories" shown
9. Multi-select exits automatically

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a much better user experience with clearer visual hierarchy, safer deletion workflow, and professional-looking UI that matches the app's design language. The conditional button logic makes the interface more intuitive and prevents accidental deletions while keeping the workflow smooth and efficient.
